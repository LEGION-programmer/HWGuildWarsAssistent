**ABOUT THE APP**

I created this application at the request of my friends for the game Hero Wars. Its purpose is to make it easier to manage wars with other guilds by recording wars that have already taken place and then easily and quickly finding specific duels so that generals can quickly plan attack targets.

**HOW TO INSTALL**

After downloading all the files in the backend and frontend folders, you will find all the information about the modules that need to be installed and how to run the application on your local computer.

**WHAT WAS THE PURPOSE OF THE APPLICATION**

When creating this application, I wanted to practice my skills and repeat the knowledge I had already acquired. I managed to work with multer for a while, although in the end it wasn't included in this project because it made it too complicated.
